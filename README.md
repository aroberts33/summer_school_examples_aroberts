# Summer School Examples
This repository is a collection of coding examples for the IceCube Summer School.

# Using GitHub
GitHub is a way to track changes and edits to code, as well as to collaborate on a code. 

To use this repository, you can `clone` it into a folder on your `scratch` directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/jessiethw/summer_school_examples.git
```

You will then have your own copy of the code in a folder called `summer_school_examples`. We will go through each example and answers during the Summer School. You should try to complete the exercises without looking at the answers, until we go through the answers together. 
Alisha has made these changes :)
